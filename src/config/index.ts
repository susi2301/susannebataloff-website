      Hi! My name is Dani, I'm a <span class="text-primary font-bold">Game Developer</span>and <span class="text-primary font-bold">Game Designer</span> as well as the founder of <span class="text-primary font-bold">Thirteen Games</span>, an independent game studio established in 2026. Game development has been my passion for years, and even while working in other fields, I always spent my free time creating and developing games.

      Before founding Thirteen Games, I gained valuable experience in project management and worked as a manager of a fitness studio. This background helped me build strong leadership, organization, and communication skills, which I now bring into my work as a developer and designer.

      I strongly believe that <span class="text-primary font-bold">indie games represent the future of the gaming industry</span>. My goal is to be part of that future by bringing my vision, creativity, and management experience into every project I work on. I am especially passionate about designing systems and transforming them into creative and engaging gameplay experiences that feel meaningful and memorable for players.

      With Thirteen Games, I aim to create unique and innovative games that stand out, inspire players, and contribute to the growing indie game community.
